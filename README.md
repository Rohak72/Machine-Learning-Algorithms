# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
The official GitHub repository for my machine learning algorithm tutorials on YouTube! From Simple Linear Regression to complicated Random Forests, this is the ultimate beginner's guide to machine learning, and I really hope you enjoy looking through some of the algorithms on your own! Feel free to access the Jupyter Notebooks containing each algorithm script in the 'Algorithms' folder. If you have any concerns or feedback regarding the project, please let me know and I will try my best to resolve the issue! 

Thanks and have a great day! - Rohak
